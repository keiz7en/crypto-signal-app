## How It Works

### Data Sources

- **Binance API**: Real-time price, volume, funding rates, long/short ratios, open interest
- **CoinGlass API**: Liquidation data across different timeframes (1h, 4h, 24h)

### Technical Analysis

- **Trend Analysis**: 5-minute and 15-minute trend detection
- **Bollinger Bands**: Breakout detection above/below bands
- **EMA Crossover**: 9-period and 21-period exponential moving average crossovers
- **Volume Analysis**: Delta volume for buy/sell pressure
- **Funding Rate Analysis**: Market sentiment through futures funding

### Signal Logic

The app analyzes multiple factors to generate signals:

1. **Bullish Signals**:
    - Upward trends on multiple timeframes
    - Bollinger band upper breakout
    - Bullish EMA crossover
    - Negative funding rate (shorts paying longs)
    - More shorts than longs in the market
    - Short liquidation spikes

2. **Bearish Signals**:
    - Downward trends on multiple timeframes
    - Bollinger band lower breakdown
    - Bearish EMA crossover
    - Positive funding rate (longs paying shorts)
    - More longs than shorts in the market
    - Long liquidation spikes

### Confidence Scoring

- Signals require minimum 70% confidence to be displayed
- Confidence increases with more confirming indicators
- News sentiment can adjust confidence by ¬±10%

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

The app analyzes 20 major cryptocurrencies:

- BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, DOGE, ADA, DOT, LTC, BCH
- AVAX, LINK, MATIC, UNI, ATOM, FTM, NEAR, ALGO, VET, ICP

## API Endpoints
